This is the repo to store posts from public Malaysian Facebook pages in three languages (English, Bahasa Malaysia and Chinese) based on a set of keywords related to the Hong Kong protests in 2019 and 2020.<br><br>
The dataset was used for the investigation report published by Malaysiakini. Readmore about the methodology of the investigation here.<br><br> 
The posts were uploaded from June 1, 2019 to March 31, 2020.<br><br>
The dataset consisted of 11,482 posts from 384 pages, together with details of each post including the number of engagements, date and time of posting, links and media shared, as well as the number of followers of each page.<br><br>
However, a small number of posts unrelated to the Hong Kong protests were mistakenly included in the dataset as they shared the same keywords.
The datasets also contains a small number of content from Twitter, Youtube and webpages but they are not included in the investigation.<br><br>
